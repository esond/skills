  Deep-strip the tells of AI writing (claudisms) from a draft while keeping its
  meaning and the writer's voice intact. Sweeps the draft against the living
  claudisms banlist at claudisms.ai (em dashes, "not just X, it's Y," delve /
  tapestry / testament / robust, "worth noting," crowned superlatives,
  signposting, rule of three) plus the constructions a text search can't catch. Use this skill
  whenever the user wants AI tells removed from writing — phrasings like
  "de-slop this," "strip the claudisms," "remove the AI tells," "humanize
  this," "scrub the AI out of this," "make this sound like I wrote it," "this
  reads like ChatGPT wrote it," or "would this pass as human?" — even if they
  never say "de-slop." This is the deep, deliberate pass for writing that
  ships under the user's name.

# De-slop: Strip the AI Tells from Writing

You take a draft that reads like a model wrote it and return one that reads
like the person whose name is on it wrote it. When writing ships under
someone's name, every AI fingerprint left in it spends that person's
credibility. Your job is to find every tell and remove it — without touching
what the draft says or who it sounds like.

This is a deep pass, not a quick polish. Expect to read the draft several
times and to work through an inventory of tells systematically. That cost is
the point: the user reaches for this skill when the writing matters.

## Two hard rules: keep the meaning, keep the voice

Everything else is judgment; these two are not.

**1. The meaning.** The reader of the cleaned draft must walk away knowing
exactly what the reader of the original would have — same facts, same claims,
same numbers, same names, same asks, same conclusions. Stripping a tell never
justifies dropping the content it was wrapped around. If a banned phrase is
carrying a real point ("it's worth noting the deadline moved" carries "the
deadline moved"), keep the point and shed the wrapper.

**2. The voice.** The goal is the writer's voice, not a third voice that is
merely "plain." Slop-stripping has its own failure mode: sanding every
sentence into beige, uniform prose — which is itself an AI tell. Whatever
personality, humor, bluntness, or rhythm survives in the original is the
signal; amplify it by clearing the slop away from it. When the draft gives
you samples of how the writer actually sounds (an unslopped paragraph, a
distinctive turn of phrase), match those. When it doesn't, prefer the
plainest direct statement and flag places where only the author can supply
the voice.

## Step 1: Load the inventory

Read the bundled banlist at `references/claudisms.md`, relative to this
skill's directory. It is a verbatim snapshot of the living inventory at
https://claudisms.ai/claudisms.md — 80+ confirmed claudisms plus structural
tics, register tics, and spoken-word tells, each with the reasoning and
preferred rewrites. The upstream list grows, so the snapshot is worth
re-downloading over the bundled copy from time to time.

If the file is somehow missing, say so in one line and proceed — the
construction and structure families in Step 3 still cover the
highest-signal tells by shape.

One caution: the inventory encodes a few of its author's house-style
conventions alongside the genuine AI tells — pieces are "articles" not
"essays," em dashes become spaced hyphens (` - `). Strip the *tell* (the em
dash, the tic), but choose replacements that fit **this** user's writing, not
the list author's. An em dash can become a comma, a period, parentheses, or a
spaced hyphen — whichever the surrounding voice would pick.

## Step 2: Read the draft and note what must survive

Before changing anything, read the whole draft and write down:

- Every fact, claim, number, name, quote, ask, and conclusion — this is your
  meaning checklist for the end.
- The register: is it a blog post, a LinkedIn post, an email, a Slack
  message, a doc? Formal or casual? Warm or dry? The output must stay in the
  same register and roughly the same length — de-slopping compresses a
  little (filler leaves), but a draft that comes back half as long has lost
  content, not slop.
- Any lines that already sound like a person. Those are your voice anchors —
  leave them alone and tune the rest toward them.

## Step 3: Sweep for tells — three passes

A single read misses too much, and the inventory itself warns why: many
claudisms are *constructions*, not phrases, so a literal match on the listed
wording catches only the examples someone already flagged. Make three
distinct passes.

**Pass 1 — phrase sweep.** Walk the inventory and search the draft for each
listed word and phrase. This is mechanical; be exhaustive. Mark every hit.

**Pass 2 — construction sweep, by eye.** Reread looking for the *shapes*
the list describes, with any words in the slots:

- Negative parallelism: "it's not just X, it's Y," "this isn't about X. It's
  about Y." The single most-cited AI tell.
- Totalizers and crowned superlatives: "the whole [anything]," "the only
  [X] that [verb]," "the most [X]," "the one that [verb]," "the best thing
  you can do."
- Value-claim filler: any "worth [X]," "this matters," "the useful thing,"
  "the right [X]" — telling the reader what to think of a thing instead of
  letting the thing show it.
- Pseudo-reflective journey framing: "sit with," "keep coming back to,"
  "where I landed," "what struck me," "I can't stop thinking about,"
  "the thing that got me."
- Placement and agency metaphors for abstractions: ideas that "live,"
  "hold," "carry," "compound," "ride along"; words "doing the work"; "the
  engine," "the shape of," "load-bearing," "the physics of."
- Invented observation and invented emotion: "most people I've talked to,"
  "everyone I've worked with," "hit a nerve," "stuck with me" — claims of
  experience or reaction that were never actually described.

**Pass 3 — structure and rhythm.** Zoom out from words to the draft's
skeleton:

- Signposting and throat-clearing: announcing points before making them,
  "Here's where it gets interesting," "Let's break it down," restating the
  question before answering it.
- Rule of three: adjectives, clauses, and examples forced into triples.
- Flattened syntax: every sentence the same comfortable mid-length, opening
  with the subject. Also its cousin, four-plus staccato declaratives in a
  row, and "No X. No Y. Just Z."
- Formatting tells: em dashes, `---` section dividers, "**Bold term:**
  explanation" lists, emoji, a one-liner close that restates the thesis,
  a sweeping "In today's rapidly evolving..." opener.
- Even, mechanical transitions: "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover,"
  "That said" stitching every paragraph.

## Step 4: Rewrite each hit

Work through the marked hits. For each one:

- **Say the thing directly.** Nearly every entry in the inventory reduces to
  the same fix: the tell dresses up a plain statement, so find the plain
  statement and write it. "The tension lives in the gap between X and Y"
  means "X and Y conflict." Write that.
- **Cut rather than swap when the tell is pure filler.** "It's worth noting
  that the deploy finished" is "The deploy finished." Value-claims,
  throat-clearing, and signposting usually delete cleanly.
- **Don't trade one tic for another.** The inventory records replacements
  that later got banned themselves ("keep coming back to" was once the
  suggested fix for "arriving at"). After rewriting a sentence, check your
  replacement against the same list.
- **Vary the rhythm on purpose.** When fixing flattened syntax, mix short
  and long sentences the way the writer's voice anchors do. One-word
  punches, asides, and fragments are human; use them where the register
  allows.
- **Leave the writer's own quirks alone.** If a flagged word is plainly the
  user's genuine usage (their industry's term of art, a phrase they use in
  the voice anchors), keep it and note the judgment call in the summary
  rather than silently "fixing" their voice.

## Step 5: Re-sweep your own output

Rewrites introduce tells. This is the most common failure of a de-slopping
pass: the em dashes come out and negative parallelism goes in, or the
replacement sentence reaches for "robust" or a neat rule of three. Run
Pass 2 and Pass 3 from Step 3 against the *finished* draft, treating it as
suspect. Then walk the meaning checklist from Step 2 — anything missing or
distorted gets restored.

## Step 6: Deliver

Lead with the cleaned draft itself, in a block that copies cleanly into
wherever it's going. Below it, keep commentary short:

- A compact summary of what was stripped, grouped by family ("removed 6 em
  dashes, 2 negative parallelisms, 3 'worth X' value-claims...") — enough
  for the user to trust the pass without rereading everything.
- Judgment calls, if any: flagged words you kept because they read as the
  user's own voice, places where only the author can supply a replacement
  (a real anecdote where the draft had an invented one), and any meaning
  you could not preserve while removing a tell (rare — say why).

Do not deliver a line-by-line diff or lecture on each change; the user came
for the clean draft.

## What not to do

- **Don't change the answer, facts, or claims.** A clean draft that says
  something different is a failure, not a success.
- **Don't sand the voice flat.** Uniform beige prose is a tell too. If the
  original had bite, the output has bite.
- **Don't invent to fill gaps.** Where the draft fabricated experience
  ("most people I've talked to..."), cut the fabrication or flag it for the
  author to replace with something true — never substitute a new invented
  anecdote.
- **Don't impose the inventory's house style.** Strip tells; pick
  replacements in the user's voice.
- **Don't shorten for its own sake.** Filler leaves, content stays. If the
  draft comes back dramatically shorter, you cut meaning.
- **Don't skip the re-sweep.** Your rewrites are drafts too, and they get
  the same scrutiny.
