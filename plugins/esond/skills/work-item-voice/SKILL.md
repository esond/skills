description: >-
  Write or edit the user's issues in their own voice, in any work tracker —
  Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps. Covers features (new behavior),
  tasks (work that needs doing), and bugs (behavior that does not match
  expectation). Load this whenever the deliverable is an issue body, whether
  they say "file a bug", "write a ticket", "draft a story", "create an issue for
  this", "turn this into a Jira", "write this up in Linear", or paste a thread
  and ask for an issue out of it. Load it too whenever text goes into an issue
  that already exists — "record this in the issue", "add what we found to the
  ticket", "note this on the card", "update the one about refunds", or naming an
  issue by its key and asking for a fact to go in it — and when writing or
  updating one is a step inside a larger task. Features get behavior-driven
  framing with no implementation prescribed, and bugs get expected versus
  actual. Not for a comment on an issue, which is a conversation turn.

# Work item voice

An issue is a request for work, written by one person and read by many. Every
reader pays for what the writer did not bother to cut, and every reader loses
options the writer closed off by guessing at the solution. Those two costs are
what this skill exists to keep down.

Before you draft, read
`../conversational-voice/references/writing-for-people.md`, the file
`conversational-voice` owns. It holds the rules this skill shares with
`conversational-voice`. What follows here is what is specific to an issue.

If that read fails, draft anyway and say so in one line. The rules below still
apply, but the shared ones are missing, and the user needs to know that before
they file the issue.

## When this applies

It applies when you are authoring the body of a work item: a feature, a task, or
a bug, in whatever tracker the team uses. It applies the same way to an issue
that already exists — rewriting it, tightening it, or adding a single fact to
it. Editing has its own section below.

It does not apply to a *comment* on an issue. That is a turn in a conversation
with a person, so it belongs to the sibling skill `conversational-voice`. The
split is authored artifact versus conversational turn, not tool.

## The three kinds

**Feature** — something new the product needs. The issue describes desired
behavior and the outcome that behavior produces.

**Bug** — behavior does not match expectation. Something works differently than
it is supposed to.

**Task** — work that needs doing rather than designing: maintenance, an upgrade,
a migration, a cleanup. Tasks are allowed to be more technical, because the
question is usually *do this*, not *figure out what to do*.

Most of what follows applies to all three. Where a kind differs, it says so.

## Do not prescribe the implementation

This is the constraint that holds everywhere, including bugs.

The developer who picks up the issue knows things the author does not. They know
what landed last week, which abstraction is already half-built, and which of the
three obvious fixes has bitten them before. An issue that names the solution
throws all of that away, and it does so silently — nobody argues with a spec.

So point, do not dictate. "The retry count resets somewhere in
`OrderDispatcher`" hands over a real lead. "Move the retry count into Redis"
hands over a decision that was not yours to make.

The common way this goes wrong now: someone points an LLM at the codebase, asks
why a bug happened, and files the answer. What lands in the tracker is a
diagnosis wearing an issue's clothes. The reported behavior is a sentence at the
top, and the rest is a proposed fix nobody asked for. If you have a hypothesis,
it goes at the bottom, marked as a hypothesis, or it stays out.

An issue can still carry an implementation detail when the detail is genuinely a
constraint: a deadline set by a vendor API, a table that cannot change, a
decision already made and recorded elsewhere. Say it as a constraint and say who
set it. That is different from designing the fix.

## Features: describe the behavior, not the machinery

Write the problem statement so it would make sense in 1922. Almost all software
does something a person could already do by hand, just slower and less
reliably — so describe that thing. A clerk, a ledger, a phone call, a filing
cabinet. If the sentence cannot survive the removal of computers, it is probably
describing machinery instead of behavior.

That framing is what makes room for concrete detail. Behavior-driven writing
wants the specifics of the problem domain: real names, real dates, real amounts,
a real example of the case that fails. "A customer on the annual plan cancels on
day 40 and expects a prorated refund" is worth more than three paragraphs about
subscription state.

The user story shape — as a *someone*, when *something*, so that *outcome* — is
welcome whenever it fits, and it is not required. Do not force a feature into it.
The part of that shape that usually earns its place is the persona: who wants
this, and what they get. That answers questions a shape alone does not.

What every feature must contain, in whatever form suits it:

- What is desired
- What the outcome is once it exists

Everything else is optional. Background is the optional part worth keeping.

After the spec is done — what is wanted, the outcome, whatever acceptance
criteria you wrote — an addendum on why this exists and how it came about earns
its place. Where it came from, who asked, what the team tried before, the
constraint that made it urgent. This part reads more prosaic than the rest, and
that is fine. It answers the questions a developer asks in week three rather
than on day one.

Position is what makes it free. A reader who only needs to start reads the top
and stops, so nothing is spent on them. That works only when background sits
last, under its own heading, and never gets mixed into the statement of what is
wanted. A task with real history can carry the same addendum.

## Bugs: what happened, what was expected, how to see it

Bugs get a light skeleton, because the three facts a developer needs first are
always the same and are easy to leave out:

- **What happened** — the observed behavior, stated plainly.
- **What was expected** — and where that expectation comes from, if it is not
  obvious.
- **How to see it** — steps, or the conditions under which it shows up.

Add environment, frequency, and blast radius when you know them. Add a pointer
to a suspicious bit of code when you have one, as a lead rather than a verdict.

## Tasks: the outcome and the edges

A task needs the outcome it produces and a clear enough boundary that someone
knows when it is finished. Technical vocabulary is fine here. Prescribing *how*
is still not.

## The test for what survives

The shared reference states the compression rule. Long issues are where it bites
hardest, because one person writes the issue and every reader after them pays.
The test for any sentence here: **does a developer need this fact to start?**

Keep a date, an amount, a customer name, a concrete failing example, an
expectation and where it came from, a constraint someone else set. Cut a log
excerpt nobody asked for, a list of files you happened to read, the story of
your own debugging session, and anything included to show that research was
done. Research that shaped the issue is already in the issue, in the form of a
shorter issue.

When issues are linked, the test crosses between them. The spike or the parent
holds the evidence. A downstream issue cites the conclusion and points at where
it came from — the issue key, and the question it answers. Copying the same
evidence into four issues makes it rot in four places, because the next finding
only corrects one of them.

A background addendum is the one exemption, and it survives on a different test.
It fails "need this to start" by design. It passes because it sits last, under
its own heading, where a reader who is done reading has already stopped. Keep it
that way and it costs nobody anything. Move it up front and it is a context
dump.

## Language

Write for a reader whose first language is not English.

Short sentences. One idea in each. Active voice, and name who acts. Plain words
over impressive ones. State a condition before the thing it governs. No idioms,
because they are the first thing to fail across languages.

That is the flavor of ASD-STE100 and not the whole standard. Certified
compliance is not the goal. A term from the problem domain stays as it is, even
when a plainer word exists, because renaming the domain to sound simpler makes
the issue wrong.

Some of the AI tells catalogued in `conversational-voice` carry over. An issue
that opens with a summary of itself, lists exactly three considerations, or ends
on a tidy restatement reads as generated, and readers discount it.

## Formatting

The rule against mechanical structure in `conversational-voice` does not carry
over. That one is calibrated for Slack, where most messages are one paragraph.
A tracker is the opposite. People scan issues, come back to them weeks later,
and read them next to twenty others.

So headings, bold labels, and short lists earn their place here. Use them where
they help someone find one fact fast: the date, the expected behavior, the
condition that means done. Skip them when the issue is two sentences long, since
structure around nothing is its own kind of noise.

Match the shape to the content, the same way you match the length to it.

**Do not hard-wrap the body.** Every tracker soft-wraps to the reader's window.
A body wrapped at 80 columns reads badly on a phone, fights the next person who
edits it, and turns a one-word change into a reflowed paragraph. Write each
paragraph as one long line and let the tracker break it.

The examples below break this rule, and they will mislead you if you copy their
shape. They wrap at 80 columns because this file does. Take their structure and
their register. Do not take their line breaks.

## Examples

**A feature:**

> **Prorate refunds when an annual plan is cancelled mid-term**
>
> A customer on the annual plan cancels partway through the year. Today they get
> nothing back. They expect money back for the months they will not use.
>
> Priya subscribes on 1 March for $240. She cancels on 9 April, 40 days in. She
> expects about $214 back, the value of the 325 days she will not use.
>
> Once this exists, a customer who cancels early gets a refund for the unused
> part of the term, and sees the amount before they confirm the cancellation.
>
> **Background**
>
> Support has handled these by hand since we launched annual billing. It was
> fine at a handful a month. It is now about forty, and Dana raised it after two
> customers were refunded the wrong amount in June. We looked at blocking
> mid-term cancellation instead and decided against it, because renewals are the
> thing we actually want to protect.

Not: "Add a `prorate()` helper to `SubscriptionService` that computes remaining
days over 365 and calls the Stripe refund endpoint. We should cache the plan
price on the subscription row so we don't hit the price table on every
cancellation."

**A bug:**

> **Orders placed during a deploy never reach the warehouse**
>
> **What happened.** Between 09:12 and 09:15 ET on 4 August, 23 orders were
> confirmed to the customer and never appeared in the warehouse queue. The cards
> were charged.
>
> **What was expected.** Every confirmed order reaches the warehouse. Support
> tells customers that a confirmation means the order is committed.
>
> **How to see it.** Place an order while a deploy is in progress. It happened
> on all three attempts on staging.
>
> One lead, not a diagnosis: the dispatcher's retry buffer is in memory, so a
> restart is worth looking at.

Not: "The dispatcher loses its retry buffer on restart because it's held in a
local list. We need to move it to Redis so it survives deploys. See
`OrderDispatcher.cs:88`." Followed by forty lines of log.

**A task:**

> **Move the nightly export off the retired reporting database**
>
> The reporting database is switched off on **30 September**. The nightly
> customer export still reads from it, so the export stops working that day.
>
> **Done when**
>
> - The export runs against a supported source.
> - It produces the same columns it produces today.
> - Its output matches the current export for a week of sample dates.

Not: "Rewrite `NightlyExportJob` to take `IWarehouseClient` instead of
`IReportingDbClient`, port the SQL to the new star schema, and put it behind a
feature flag so we can roll back." A task can use technical vocabulary. It still
does not get to design the work.

Notice what the good versions share. Each one names the behavior and the gap,
carries the few facts a developer needs to start, and stops. None of them says
how to build it.

## Editing an issue that already exists

Most writing into a tracker is not authoring from nothing. Someone answers an
open question, a finding lands, a date moves — and the fact goes into a body
that already has an author. That is still this skill, and the request rarely
sounds like writing. "Record this in the issue", "add what we found to the
ticket", "update the one about refunds" all produce issue prose.

Two rules make an edit different from a first draft.

**Inherit the voice, or fix it.** You are writing into prose you did not write.
An edit that ignores the register around it degrades a good issue one append at
a time, and nobody ever notices the step that did it. Match what is there. When
what is there is bad enough that matching it makes the issue worse, rewrite the
part you touched and say which part.

**Re-read the whole body after you edit it.** A new fact often contradicts an
older one, and the older one goes on looking true. Nobody else re-reads the top
of the issue. The next person to pick it up sees both statements and has no way
to tell which one is current.

Appending to a body is still an authored artifact. A comment on that same issue
is a conversational turn, so it belongs to `conversational-voice`. That is the
same split as above, and the tracker does not decide it.

### The tracker rewrites your markdown

This bites on the round trip — you write a body, then patch it later and the
patch does not match.

Linear renumbers ordered lists. `1., 2., 4., 5b., 9.` comes back as `1.`
through `8.`, so any meaning carried by the numbers is gone. It also normalizes
`-` bullets to `*`, which breaks an exact-match edit afterward.

So never put meaning in an ordered list's numbers. Put the key in the text,
where the tracker cannot touch it: `**Q4b —** ...`. Before you patch by exact
match, read the body back from the tracker rather than trusting what you sent.

## Delivering the draft

The shared reference says to lead with the artifact, in a block that copies
cleanly. That assumes a person does the copying, which is not always true here.

**When a person pastes it.** Lead with a title line, then the body in a fenced
block. The fenced block is where the wrapping rule gets broken, because a wall
of text looks wrong in a terminal. Do not wrap it anyway. What is inside the
block is what someone pastes, and the hard breaks travel with it.

**When a tool writes it.** A new issue still shows its full body first, because
that is the confirmation gate below. An edit is different. Nobody pastes an
edit, and echoing the whole body into the terminal spends the reader's
attention on text they can read in the tracker. Report the issue key and the
part you added or rewrote, then stop.

A title says what is wrong or what is wanted, in one line, without a prefix
naming the type — the tracker already carries that field.

## Filing and updating

Drafting is the default. Writing to the tracker happens on request. What the
request buys differs between a new issue and an edit.

**A new issue gets a gate.** Stop and confirm before the write. Show the
rendered title and body, name the target — project, repository, board, or
team — and name the type. Wait for a yes. Filing notifies people and is awkward
to retract, so treat the confirmation as real rather than as a formality.

**An edit at explicit request does not.** "Record this in the issue" is the
instruction and the permission in one sentence. Asking again spends a turn on
something the user already answered. Make the edit, then report what changed.

Two things still stop an edit. A rewrite wider than what was asked needs a yes
first, because "add this finding" does not authorize reshaping the body around
it. Deleting someone else's prose needs one too.

Create or patch with whatever tool fits: the Jira or Linear MCP tools, `gh issue
create` and `gh issue edit`, or the tracker the user names. Report back the key
or URL.

## What this does not do

- It does not triage, prioritize, estimate, or assign.
- It does not decide whether the issue is worth filing.
- It does not write the fix, or a plan for the fix, inside the issue.
